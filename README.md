# Radioberry-2.x-extensions
Hardware extensions to the Radioberry Ham Radio


Deepu Augustin VU3TLD, from India made the next step to make a complete stackable HAM radio.

He started with a Power Amplifier board, based on the G6ALU 20W PA; version 1.5 is available and
the first components are in place.

He also is aiming for a filter board; a version 1.3 is available; first PCB's are underway!


An animation of the idea of such a configuration can be found => Radioberry_radio_assembly.avi file.
